    <p>The lovechild of Pinne and Kil became Kvist.</p>
    <p>With the competitive qualities from Kil, such as cut outs to avoid wheel bites when riding hard and deep concaves, it inherited its good retro looks from Pinne.</p>

    <p>Kil is a wide, tall and stiff board with great stability. It’s an ordinary concave in the front while it has a W concave in the back.</p>
    <p>Top mounted trucks, the hardness of the board and the W concave makes a matchless combination of stability and control. The W concave gives maximal grip and feel when doing toe side turns and slides. In other words, the perfect board for the dowhill control freak.</p>

    <p>Löv is a cruiseboard that lets you glide.</p>
    <p>The board is long and thin with a big tail kick that reacts rapidly allowing both more technical riding and laidback cruising. The board has plenty of space for cross steps and dancing.</p>

    <p>Like a splinter of the Pinne board. The same easygoing retro styling but in a more practical format for those who want to carry the board with them everywhere they go. This quick and agile board will turn every obstacle into splinters.</p>

    <p>Urskog’s model Stubbe is a drop through board perfect for freeriding. We made it slightly shorter than the average dropthrough model which gives a great turn ratio without comprimising on its stability. Stubbe has a core of 7 layers of Swedish Birch and gives a semi-hard flex.</p>
