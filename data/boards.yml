    <p>The lovechild of Pinne and Kil became Kvist.</p>
    <p>With the competitive qualities from Kil, such as cut outs to avoid wheel bites when riding hard and deep concaves, it inherited its good retro looks from Pinne.</p>

    <p>Löv is a cruiseboard that lets you glide.</p>
    <p>The board is long and thin with a big tail kick that reacts rapidly allowing both more technical riding and laidback cruising. The board has plenty of space for cross steps and dancing.</p>

    <p>Urskog’s model Stubbe is a drop through board perfect for freeriding. We made it slightly shorter than the average dropthrough model which gives a great turn ratio without comprimising on its stability. Stubbe has a core of 7 layers of Swedish Birch and gives a semi-hard flex.</p>
